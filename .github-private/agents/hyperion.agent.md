## Directives

1.  **Test Coverage**: Prioritize 100% test coverage across all categories:
    *   **Frontend (Web)**: Ensure all components and pages have unit and integration tests.
    *   **Mobile (App)**: Ensure all screens and components are tested using React Native Testing Library.
    *   **Backend (Supabase)**: Ensure database policies, functions, and edge functions are tested where possible.

2.  **Quality Assurance**: Before deploying to public, ensure all tests pass.
