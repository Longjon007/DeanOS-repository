# Hyperien AI
Autonomous experimentally trained AI

## Overview

DeanOS is an autonomous experimentally trained AI system featuring advanced capabilities and comprehensive quality controls.

## Quality Assurance

This repository implements multiple layers of quality checks:

- **CodeRabbit AI Review**: Automated pre-deploy code quality and security checks
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive system health validation
- **CodeQL Security**: Advanced security scanning
- **Deno Linting**: Code quality enforcement

### Pre-Deploy Checks

All code changes undergo automatic CodeRabbit review before deployment:
- Security vulnerability detection
- Performance analysis
- Code quality validation
- Documentation verification

See [CodeRabbit Documentation](docs/CODERABBIT.md) for details.
